# 🎙️ Move Your Mouse with Just Your Voice   
A small Python script that lets you control your mouse movement using simple voice commands.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This script uses speech recognition with mouse automation to allow basic hands-free control of your computer.  
Say commands like `"left"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, or `"down"` to control your mouse.

## 💡 Why I Built This

This script was one of my first mini projects with Python and helped me to learn some of the Python syntax while building the base of something cool.
I intend to build on this further in the future and possibly build a game around it.
